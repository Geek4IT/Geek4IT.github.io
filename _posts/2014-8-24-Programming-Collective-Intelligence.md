##Chapter #2 Making Recommendations

Recommendation Engine are of two types:

####User based
Recommendation of anything to you based on your data or your profile, like Facebook recommending you friends(though it is more of a collective intelligence) or Gmail displaying ad on the basis of your mails. It can also be collaborative. Collaborative is when other users are also taken into consideration for your recommendation, not only your profile.

####Item based 
Recommendation of anything to you based on the item you are watching. Eg:- Amazon recommending you books when you were going through the books related to collective intelligence or recommendations.

##Euclidean Distance
[Euclidean Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) finds the distance between two points in multidimensional space, which is the kind of distance you measure with a ruler. If the points are written as (p1, p2, p3, p4, ...) and (q1, q2, q3, q4, ...), then the formula for Euclidean distance can be expressed as shown：

##Pearson Correlation Coefficient
[Pearson Correlation Coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) is a measure of how highly correlated two variables are. It is a value between 1 and –1, where 1 indicates that the variables are per- fectly correlated, 0 
indicates no correlation, and –1 means they are perfectly inversely correlated.
