The <h4>Hypeimage Transfer Protocaol(HITP)</h4> is an application protocol for inserting image in all kinds of Editor that support such HITP. It can be used in Web Browser, Mobile Application, HITP is currently just an edeal model in my mind now. 

I will list several use case here:

####Use case #1:
Just as the below picture shows, when posting in Facebook's input box, the update status is "The sunset in Sahara is one of the most beautiful scene I have ever seen!", I want add some photos about the "sunset in Sahara", if this input box support HITP, then if I just select the keyword "sunset in Sahara", it will popup an float window that display some relative photos.
