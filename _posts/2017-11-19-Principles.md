**Why are  principles  important？**

* Esssiential for getting what we want out of life.
* If we want to understand each other.we need ot understand each other’s principles.
* All successful people have principles.
* Without principles you will be forced to react to circumstances that you don’t know what you value most,and how to get what you want most.this will prevent you from making most of your life.
* Without principles ,people in groups will not understand how to behave consistent with others.



**What are principles？**

Allow your action consistent with your values.(values are about what you consider is important ). They like beacons guide you behaviors and help you face hard choices.



**How to get principles？**

* Forge them by yourself from our own experiences and reflections on those experiences.
* Accept others’ principles ,even holistic packaged principles.(it is not necessarily a bad thing to use others’ principles,but having others’ without much thought may lead a risk of inconsistency to your true values. )



**My Most Fundamental Life Principles** 

* Time is like a river that will take you forward into encounters with reality that will require you to make decisions. You can’t stop the movement down this river, and you can’t avoid the encounters. You can only approach these encounters in the best way possible. (That is what this part is all about.)
* In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.
* The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you have to be right when they’re wrong.
* I want you to work for yourself, to come up with independent opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being overconfident, and to reflect on the consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.
* 1) Working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stresstesting my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.
* I learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people think is bad.
* I learned that there is nothing to fear from truth.
* I learned that being truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me.
* I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them.
* In short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid rate of improvement and movement toward what I wanted.
* While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.
* **While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.**
* While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.
* While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting them stand in your way.
* While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.



**My Most Fundamental Principles**

* My most fundamental principle: Truth — more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality — is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.
* This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws.
* I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.
* I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving force.
* It is natural for us to seek other things or to seek to make the things we have better.
* In other words, the sequence of **1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again** is the personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.
* I believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded.
* Self-interest and society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of self interest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that contribute to society. In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted—NOT how much they desired to make money.
* Most of us are born with attributes that both help us and hurt us, depending on their applications, and the more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good and bad outcomes these attributes are likely to produce.
* In nature everything was made for a purpose, and so too were these different ways of thinking.
* The most importantly to understand one’s own values and abilities—and then to find the right fits.
* The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.
* **As a result of them, most people don’t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing them from causing them problems. Most people especially dislike others exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions.**
* It is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to experience bad outcomes.
