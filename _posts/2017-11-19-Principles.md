### 二、书摘



**Why are  principles  important？**

* Esssiential for getting what we want out of life.
* If we want to understand each other.we need ot understand each other’s principles.
* All successful people have principles.
* Without principles you will be forced to react to circumstances that you don’t know what you value most,and how to get what you want most.this will prevent you from making most of your life.
* Without principles ,people in groups will not understand how to behave consistent with others.



**What are principles？**

Allow your action consistent with your values.(values are about what you consider is important ). They like beacons guide you behaviors and help you face hard choices.



**How to get principles？**

* Forge them by yourself from our own experiences and reflections on those experiences.
* Accept others’ principles ,even holistic packaged principles.(it is not necessarily a bad thing to use others’ principles,but having others’ without much thought may lead a risk of inconsistency to your true values. )



**My Most Fundamental Life Principles** 

* Time is like a river that will take you forward into encounters with reality that will require you to make decisions. You can’t stop the movement down this river, and you can’t avoid the encounters. You can only approach these encounters in the best way possible. (That is what this part is all about.)
* In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.
* The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you have to be right when they’re wrong.
* I want you to work for yourself, to come up with independent opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being overconfident, and to reflect on the consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.
* 1) Working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stresstesting my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.
* I learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people think is bad.
* I learned that there is nothing to fear from truth.
* I learned that being truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me.
* I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them.
* In short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid rate of improvement and movement toward what I wanted.
* While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.
* **While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.**
* While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.
* While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting them stand in your way.
* While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.



**My Most Fundamental Principles**

* My most fundamental principle: Truth — more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality — is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.
* This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws.
* I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.
* I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving force.
* It is natural for us to seek other things or to seek to make the things we have better.
* In other words, the sequence of **1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again** is the personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.
* I believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded.
* Self-interest and society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of self interest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that contribute to society. In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted—NOT how much they desired to make money.
* Most of us are born with attributes that both help us and hurt us, depending on their applications, and the more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good and bad outcomes these attributes are likely to produce.
* In nature everything was made for a purpose, and so too were these different ways of thinking.
* The most importantly to understand one’s own values and abilities—and then to find the right fits.
* The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.
* **As a result of them, most people don’t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing them from causing them problems. Most people especially dislike others exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions.**
* It is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to experience bad outcomes.



**The Personal Evolutionary Process**



The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.



We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it.



Reality + Dreams + Determination = A Successful Life



What is essential is that you are clear about what you want and that you figure out how to get it.



This basic principle suggests that you can follow one of two paths to happiness: 

* Have high expectations and strive to exceed them;
* Lower your expectations so that they are at or below your conditions.

Most of us choose the first path, which means that to be happy we have to keep evolving.



The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.



Most learning comes from making mistakes, reflecting on the causes of the mistakes, and learning what to do differently in the future. Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly, because it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress.



Pain + Reflection = Progress



People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future. 



People who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident that they have the best possible answers.



**Your Two Yous and Your Machine**



Those who are most successful are capable of “higher level thinking”.



 I call it “higher level thinking” because your perspective is of one who is looking down on at your machine and yourself objectively.



![](/images/Principles/Thinking Machine.png)



**Think of it as though there are two yous—you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve your goals (let’s call that one you(1)) and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission (which we will call you(2)). You(2) are a resource that you(1) have to get what you(1) want, but by no means your only resource. To be successful you(1) have to be objective about you(2).**



If you(1) see that you(2) are not capable of doing something, it is only sensible for you(1) to have someone else do it. In other words, you(1) should look down on you(2) and all the other resources at your(1) disposal and create a “machine” to achieve your(1) goals, remembering that you(1) don’t necessarily need to do anything other than to design and manage the machine to get what you(1) want. If you(1) find that you(2) can’t do something well fire yourself(2) and get a good replacement! You shouldn’t be upset that you found out that you(2) are bad at that—you(1) should be happy because you(1) have improved your(1) chances of getting what you(1) want. If you(1) are disappointed because you(2) can’t be the best person to do everything, you(1) are terribly naïve because nobody can do everything well.



The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively. If they could just get around this, they could live up to their potentials.



**My 5-Step Process to Getting What You Want Out of Life**



“The Process” consists of five distinct steps: a) Have clear goals. b) Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals. c) Accurately diagnose these problems. d) Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals. e) Implement these plans—i.e., do these tasks.



A few general points about the process: a) You must approach these as distinct steps rather than blur them together. b) Each of these five steps requires different talents and disciplines. c) It is essential to approach this process in a very clear-headed, rational way rather than emotionally.



Treat your life like a game or a martial art. Your mission is to figure out how to get around your challenges to get to your goals. In the process of playing the game or practicing this martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will progress to ever-higher levels of the game that will require—and teach you—greater skills.



By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn’t give a damn what you “like.” So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things—which often are difficult but produce good results—so that you’ll then deserve to get what you want.
