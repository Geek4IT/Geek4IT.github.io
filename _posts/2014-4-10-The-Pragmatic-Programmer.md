###Care About Your Craft

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?

###Think! About Your Work

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.

###Donâ€™t Live with Broken Windows

Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.

Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio

Make learning a habit.
