###Chapter 1: Clean code
- Straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide
- First make it work -> Make it clean and work


###Chapter 2: Meaningful Names
- Use Intention-Revealing Names
- Avoid “noise” words in variable names. 

	Instead of ProductInfo or ProductData, just use Product. “Info” and “Data” don’t provide real meaning or anything more specific.

- Use Pronounceable Names
- Think about the “search friendliness” of a name. 

	you had to come back in 6 months and find this code, what would you search for? Using constants instead of numbers can also help. 

- Don't Be Cute
- Pick One Word per Concept
- Class Names should usually be Nouns.
- Method names should usually be Verbs.

###Chapter 3: Functions
- Do One Thing
- Have No Side Effects
- Don't Repeat Yourself
