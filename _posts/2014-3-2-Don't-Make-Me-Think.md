##Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2nd Edition) Summary
--------

Key PointsDon't make me think? refers to the idea that when a web site makes you stop and think about what you are doing, it's making your life harder, and perhaps isn't designed as well as it could be.
Chapter highlightsChapter 1 Don't make me think!

Acts as an introduction to the rest of the book. It also explains the two types of thinking your users engage in and why one of them is bad. Hint: if your users are busy thinking about how to navigate though your site, they aren't thinking about buying your product or service.

Dozens of other things that visitors to a site shouldn’t spend their time
thinking about, like:

	* Where am I?
	* Where should I begin?
	* Where did they put ____ ?
	* What are the most important things on this page?
	* Why did they call it that?

Chapter 2 How we really use the web
Scanning , satisficing, and muddling through

     Most people don't read an entire web page, but simply scan it for the first thing that looks good, which they then proceed to click. People don't attempt a thorough understanding of a web site, but prefer to satisfice - making do with what seems like pretty good choices.

We don’t read pages. We scan them.

	* We’re usually in a hurry.
	* We know we don’t need to read everything.
	* We’re good at it. We’ve been scanning newspapers, magazines, and books all our lives to find the parts we’re interested in , and we know that it works.We don’t make optical choice s. We satisfice.



     In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best option- we 
choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisfying. As soon as 
we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a
very good chance that we’ll click it.

Why don’t Web users look for the best choice?

	*  We’re usually in a hurry.
	* There’s not much of a penalty for guessing wrong.
	* Weighing options may not improve our chances On poorly designed sites, putting effort into making the best choice doesn’t really help. You’re usually better off going with your first guess and using the Back button if it doesn’t work out


	* Guessing is more fun.




Chapter 3 Billboard Design 101

Designing pages for scanning, not reading
Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are five
important things you can do to make sure they see- and understand- as
much of your site as possible.


	* Create a clear visual hierarchy.

	* Nest text to show what belongs to what.

	* Conventions are useful,Stick to them unless you have a really good reason, because they help people to avoid thinking.

	* Clearly define portions of a page.It should be very clear what is clickable.

	* 
Try and avoid noise.





Create a clear visual hierarchy

	* The more important something is, the more prominent it is.
	* Things that are related logically are also related visually
	* Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what

Conventions are you friends
Conventions enable users to figure out a lot about a Web page, even if they
can’t understand a word of it.

	* They’re very useful
	* Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.

Try and avoid noise
One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise. There are
really two kinds of noise:

	* Busy-ness
	* Background noise.

Users have varying tolerance for complexity and distractions: some people
have no problem with busy pages and background noise, but many do.
When you’re designing Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to assume
that everything is visual noise until proven otherwise.
