[Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) cofounded PayPal, Palantir and is a legendary entrepreneur and investor. In this book, he shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. 

- EVERY MOMENT IN BUSINESS happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.

- Of course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.

- Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

-  The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist;

- If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.

- At the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. 

- The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.

- 1815 to 1914 was a period of both rapid technological development and rapid globalization. Between the First World War and Kissinger’s trip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there was rapid technological development but not much globalization. Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited technological development, mostly confined to IT.

- New technology tends to come from new ventures—startups.

- The easiest explanation for this is negative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s even harder to do it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy away from risk. 

-  At the other extreme, a lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature, but he could never create an entire industry. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

- Dot-com mania was intense but short—18 months of insanity from September 1998 to March 2000. 

- But it’s hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing.

- “ four big lessons from the dot-com crash”:1. Make incremental advances;2. Stay lean and flexible;3. Improve on the competition;4. Focus on product, not sales.

- The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.

- The airlines compete with each other, but Google stands alone. Economists use two simplified models to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.

- If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.

- In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t. In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits.

- Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.

- All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.
