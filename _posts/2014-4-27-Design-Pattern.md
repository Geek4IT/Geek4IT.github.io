In this book,the GOF(Gang Of Four) depicts design patterns as "description of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context".  

###What Is a Design Pattern?

A "Pattern" is a named,well-understood solution to a common problem in the special context.


“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then
describes the core of the solution to that problem,in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing the same thing twice.” -Christopher Alexander

Each pattern is a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a certain context, a problem, and a solution.

###A pattern has four essential elements:

> .The pattern name that we use to describe a design problem,

> .The problem that describes when to apply the pattern,

> .The solution that describes the elements that make up the design, and

> .The consequences that are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.


###Types of Design Pattern

> .Creational Patterns

	These design patterns provides way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new opreator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.


> .Structural Patterns
	
	These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

> .Behavioral Patterns

	These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.





###Design Patterns Are Not About Design

Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.
