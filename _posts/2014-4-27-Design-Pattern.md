###What Is a Design Pattern?

“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then
describes the core of the solution to that problem,in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing the same thing twice.” -Christopher Alexander

###A pattern has four essential elements:

> .The pattern name that we use to describe a design problem,

> .The problem that describes when to apply the pattern,

> .The solution that describes the elements that make up the design, and

> .The consequences that are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

###Design Patterns Are Not About Design

Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.
