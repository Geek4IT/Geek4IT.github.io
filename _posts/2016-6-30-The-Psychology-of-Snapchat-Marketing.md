1. When Snapchat was launched, Facebook was where people went for updates on family and friends, Instagram was all about beautiful photo content, and Twitter was the realtime pulse of the web. Although these 3 giants dominated the social media space, Snapchat counterbalanced their strengths and created its blue ocean strategy by capturing the attention of a young audience (people aged between 16 and 30).

2. First of all, one of the things that many people didn’t realise in the beginning was that the way Snapchat works is much closer to how we communicate face to face than any other social network. When we talk to each other, walking down the street or performing daily activities, those moments vanish. Snapchat emulates that behavior and psychology, something that no other social platform does.

4. Moments are temporary and that’s exactly the feeling and behavior that Snapchat is built upon.

Why Do People Snap?

5. Scarcity effect：
It creates artificial scarcity; users have to pay attention to each message as they open it and the message instantly feels more special, and more private because it is intended for them, them alone… and then it’s gone. The fact that Snapchat does not support upvotes, double taps, mentions and reactions as we have on Facebook and most other social media platforms, can increase users’ self esteem when posting and support their care- free snap lifestyle.

6. The feeling of artistic creation：
Yes, audiences fell in love with Snapchat because of its  lters, lenses and emojis. They use the latter to feel like artists by taking everyday situations and turning them into something hilarious.

7. A feeling of security：
The snaps are going to disappear and they won’t have to store/categorize/share/take responsibility for it. This is in stark contrast to Facebook, where users need to pay a certain amount of attention to what they post and who will see it, Snapchat takes that burden off users’ shoulders, enabling them to express themselves with ease and rest reassured that they won’t be held accountable for their photos or videos.

8. To convey different identities：
Social media has come to put a tremendous emphasis on our own identity, constantly recorded, always accumulating, stored, and presented back to us in an always-available pro le of ourselves. Traditional social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter push users into creating a stable, true and permanent self that  fits into a box. Snapchat, on the other hand, provides users with more room to behave without that behavior always de ning who they are and what they can do.

9. To show that they’re different：
What do teenagers love most? Being different! Now, they’re using Snapchat because it ain’t Facebook and this differentiates them from older generations and makes them special.
