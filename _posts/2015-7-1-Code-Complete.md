- The gap between the best software engineering practice and the average practice is very wide—perhaps wider than in any other engineering discipline. A tool that disseminates good practice would be important.

- Numerous distinct activities that go into software development. They include
 	- Problem definition
	- Requirements development
	- Construction planning	
	- Software architecture, or high-level design
	- Detailed design
	- Coding and debugging
	- Unit testing
	- Integration testing
	- Integration
	- System testing
	
- Software construction is the central activity in software development; construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to happen on every project. The main activities in construction are detailed design, coding, debugging, integration, and developer testing (unit testing and integration testing).

- It doesn't tell you how to get directly from point A to point B; it might not even know where point A and point B are. In effect, a heuristic is an algorithm in a clown suit. It's less predictable, it's more fun, and it comes without a 30-day, money-back guarantee.

- How do you use software metaphors? Use them to give you insight into your programming problems and processes. Use them to help you think about your 
programming activities and to help you imagine better ways of doing things.

- The most primitive metaphor for software development grows out of the expression "writing code."

- This doesn't mean that you have to learn how to make code out of waterborne sediment; it means that you have to learn how to add to your software systems a small amount at a time. Other words closely related to accretion are "incremental," "iterative," "adaptive," and "evolutionary." Incremental designing, building, and testing are some of the most powerful software-development concepts available.

- In incremental development, you first make the simplest possible version of the system that will run. It doesn't have to accept realistic input, it doesn't have to perform realistic manipulations on data, it doesn't have to produce realistic output—it just has to be a skeleton strong enough to hold the real system as it's developed. It might call dummy classes for each of the basic functions you have identified. This basic beginning is like the oyster's beginning a pearl with a small grain of sand.

- The image of an oyster forming a pearl is a good way to visualize incremental development, or accretion.

- Metaphors are heuristics, not algorithms.

- Thinking of software-development practices as tools in an intellectual toolbox suggests further that every programmer has many tools and that no single tool is right for every job. Choosing the right tool for each problem is one key to being an effective programmer.

- Before beginning construction of a house, a builder reviews blueprints, checks that all permits have been obtained, and surveys the house's foundation.

- The first prerequisite you need to fulfill before beginning construction is a clear statement of the problem that the system is supposed to solve. This is sometimes called "product vision," "vision statement," "mission statement," or "product definition."

- Explicit requirements help to ensure that the user rather than the programmer drives the system's functionality. If the requirements are explicit, the user can review them and agree to them. If they're not, the programmer usually ends up making requirements decisions during programming. Explicit requirements keep you from guessing what the user wants.

- Paying attention to requirements helps to minimize changes to a system after development begins. If you find a coding error during coding, you change a few lines of code and work goes on. If you find a requirements error during coding, you have to alter the design to meet the changed requirement. 

- Stable requirements are the holy grail of software development. With stable requirements, a project can proceed from architecture to design to coding to testing in a way that's orderly, predictable, and calm.

- Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen.
