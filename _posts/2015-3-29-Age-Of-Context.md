- The big question is how we will adapt to keep up with these changes. The Age of Context helps show us the way. The book examines five technology forces: mobile, social media, big data, sensors, and location-based technologies.

- A simple example is how Glass displays your specific flight information as you walk into the airline terminal. It can do that because the system knows your location and your calendar and can sense where you’re looking. The more it knows about you and your activity patterns, the better it can serve your current needs—and even predict what you might want next.

- Marvels of the contextual age are based on a tradeoff: the more the technology knows about you, the more benefits you will receive.

- All five of these forces—mobile, social media, data, sensors and location—are enjoying an economic sweet spot.

- To remain a leader, Apple and Google each needed to vie for online time, for alliances with third-party developers and to provide platforms that make those apps valuable. For Google that meant having its own operating system; for Apple it meant having maps because it saw the unquestionable value of location-based services. For Apple, and many companies, mobile apps are the secret sauce of the Age of Context; mobile mapping is the most strategic of all categories.

- In most places, company employees drive around in specially equipped cars with “tons of sensors” that analyze everything from road width, direction street signs, localized spellings, etc. Then Google takes a look at the same streets and neighborhoods via satellite, which it makes available via Google Earth.

- In the following months another 6000 Glass devices were parsed out to winners of the If I had Glass contest that the company ran. This group was composed of fewer technical professionals but, by virtue of the contest they won, they were articulate people, eager to be in the front of the line and positioned to feel they had just won—rather than paid $1500. In short, they were predisposed to speak kindly of Glass.

- The more you tell the world about yourself, the more the world can give you what you want.

- Trying to stop your personal information from being collected and used at this point is tantamount to trying to stop a tsunami by standing on a beach and punching it.

- Where mobile technologies deliver customers the right information at precisely the moment of need.

- For example, when we get into our cars, our Spotify.com music should automatically move from our phone to our car speaker. Google Calendar already knows where you need to go and it should automatically tell your car’s navigation system what it knows. Perhaps Google Maps will just move from your phone to your dashboard screen, where it will eat less battery life and be easier and safer to see. The same should be the case with other mobile apps.
