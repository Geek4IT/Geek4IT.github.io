__What is the Launcher and the Theme?__
--------

Android Launcher aka Home Replacement,presents the main view of your phone,and is responsible for launching almpost all [apps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_apps) and hosting [widgets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget).

Let me give you it an analogy:A Launcher is like your house,you can place your furnishing(apps) as you like,you can open the refrigerator(launching the apps) when you need to find something to eat.

Here are some of the listed launchers available in market:

* [Solo Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=home.solo.launcher.free)

* [Go Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gau.go.launcherex
)

* [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher)

* [Smart Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree)

The theme is the decoration of your house(launcher),so rightnow you must have many ideas to decorate your room,diy your own style:

Got it?These are two different style of icons,just like the two types of house,that is the Theme.

I have designed some icons and released two theme apps in Market
