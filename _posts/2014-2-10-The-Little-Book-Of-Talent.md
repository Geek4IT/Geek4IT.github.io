This book is a manual for building a faster brain and a better you.It is an easy-to-read and easy-to-use handbook of scientifically proven,field-tested methods to improve skills-your skills,your kids' skills,your organization's skills-in movie,art,music,sports,and business.

#GETTING STARTED

* Stare,Steal,and Be Willing to Be Stupid.

* To create the spark,and to use the fuel for deep pratice.

###TIP #1 Stare at who you want to become

###TIP #2 Spend fifteen minutes a day engraving on you brain

The key to effective engraving is to create an intense connection: to watch and listen so closely that you can imagine the feeling of performing the skill. For physical skills, project yourself inside the performer’s body. Become aware of the movement, the rhythm; try to feel the interior shape of the moves. For mental skills, simulate the skill by re-creating the expert’s decision patterns. Chess players achieve this by replaying classic games, move by move; public speakers do it by regiving great speeches complete with original inflections; musicians cover their favorite songs; some writers I know achieve this effect by retyping passages verbatim from great works. (It sounds kind of Zen,but it works).

###TIP #3 Steal without apology

All improvement is about absorbing and applying new information,and the best source of information is top performers.So steal it.

###TIP #4 Buy a notebook

###TIP #5 Be willing to be stupid

###TIP #6 Choose spartan over luxurious

###TIP #7 Before you start,figure out if it's a hard skill or a soft skill

###TIP #8 To build hard skills,work like a careful carpenter

* To develop reliable hard skills, you need to connect the right wires in your brain. In this, it helps to be careful, slow, and keenly attuned to errors. To work like a careful carpenter.

* When you learn hard skills, be precise and measured.

* Pay attention to errors, and fix them, particularly at the start.


###TIP #9 To build soft skills,play like a skateboarder

* When you practice a soft skill, focus on making a high number of varied reps, and on getting clear feedback. Don’t worry too much about making errors—the important thing is to explore.

* Soft skills are often more fun to practice, but they’re also tougher because they demand that you coach yourself.


* After each session ask yourself, What worked? What didn’t? And why?

###TIP #10 Honor hard skills

To picture your talent as a big oak tree—a massive, thick trunk of hard skills with a towering canopy of flexible soft skills up above. First build the trunk. Then work on the branches.

###TIP #11 Don't fall for the prodigy myth

If you have early success,do your best to ignore the praise and keep pushing yourself to the edges of your ability,where improment happens.If you don't have early success,don't quit.Instead,treat your early efforts as experiments,not as verdicts.Remenber,this is a marathon,not a sprint.

Embrace repetition,cultive grit,and keep big goals secret

###TIP #52 Think like a gardener,work like a carpenter

* We all want to improve our skills quickly—today, if not sooner. But the truth is, talent grows slowly. You would not criticize a seedling because it was not yet a tall oak tree; nor should you get upset because your skill circuitry is in the growth stage. Instead, build it with daily deep practice.

* Think patiently, without judgment. Work steadily, strategically, knowing that each piece connects to a larger whole.
