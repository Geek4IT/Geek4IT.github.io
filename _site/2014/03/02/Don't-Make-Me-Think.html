<h4>Key Points:</h4>

<p>Don't make me think? refers to the idea that when a web site makes you stop and think about what you are doing,it's making your life harder, and perhaps isn't designed as well as it could be.</p>

<h3>Chapter Highlights</h3>

<h3>Chapter 1 Don't make me think!</h3>

<p>Acts as an introduction to the rest of the book. It also explains the two types of thinking your users engage in and why one of them is bad.
Hint: if your users are busy thinking about how to navigate though your site, they aren't thinking about buying your product or service.</p>

<p>Dozens of other things that visitors to a site shouldn’t spend their time
thinking about, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where am I?</p></li>
<li><p>Where should I begin?</p></li>
<li><p>Where did they put ____ ?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the most important things on this page?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did they call it that?</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Chapter 2 How we really use the web</h3>

<p>Scanning , satisficing, and muddling through</p>

<p>Most people don't read an entire web page, but simply scan it for the first thing that looks good, which they then proceed to click. People don't attempt a thorough understanding of a web site, but prefer to satisfice - making do with what seems like pretty good choices.</p>

<p>We don’t read pages. We scan them.</p>

<ul>
<li>We’re usually in a hurry.</li>
<li>We know we don’t need to read everything.</li>
<li>We’re good at it. We’ve been scanning newspapers, magazines, and books all our lives to find the parts we’re interested in , and we know that it works.</li>
<li>We don’t make optical choice s. We satisfice.</li>
</ul>


<p>In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best option,we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisfying. As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a
very good chance that we’ll click it.</p>

<p>Why don’t Web users look for the best choice?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We’re usually in a hurry.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s not much of a penalty for guessing wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Weighing options may not improve our chances On poorly designed sites,putting effort into making the best choice doesn’t really help.</p></li>
<li><p>Guessing is more fun.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Chapter 3 Billboard Design 101</h3>

<p>Designing pages for scanning, not reading</p>

<p>Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are five
important things you can do to make sure they see- and understand- as
much of your site as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a clear visual hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Nest text to show what belongs to what.</p></li>
<li><p>Conventions are useful,Stick to them unless you have a really good reason, because they help people to avoid thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly define portions of a page.It should be very clear what is clickable.</p></li>
<li><p>Try and avoid noise.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Create a clear visual hierarchy</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>The more important something is, the more prominent it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Things that are related logically are also related visually</p></li>
<li><p>Things are “nested” visually to show what’s part of what</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Conventions are you friends</h4>

<p>Conventions enable users to figure out a lot about a Web page, even if they
can’t understand a word of it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They’re very useful</p></li>
<li><p>Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Try and avoid noise</h4>

<p>One of the great enemies of easy-to-grasp pages is visual noise. There are
really two kinds of noise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Busy-ness</p></li>
<li><p>Background noise.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Users have varying tolerance for complexity and distractions: some people
have no problem with busy pages and background noise, but many do.
When you’re designing Web pages, it’s probably a good idea to assume
that everything is visual noise until proven otherwise.</p>
