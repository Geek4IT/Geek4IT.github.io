  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm twenty-something boy, ambitious futurist, avid-student of life, start-up guy in Tech, and live in Beijing now.
  <p>This is my personal blog about Software Engineering, Computer Science, Technology, News, Ideas...<p>
  <p>I hate the word: "success", and always looking for the "Aha moment"! Building stuff is one of the most excited things in the world. I am eager to learn more, explore more and do more! Keep calm & be cool!</p>
  <p>I <a href="http://geek4it.com/books.html">Read</a><p>
  <p>I <a href="https://github.com/Geek4IT">Code</a><p>
  <p>I <a href="http://geek4it.com">Write</a><p>
  <p>Geek4IT = Geek for IT<p>
  <p>Geek means the passion, love and concentration for something.<p>
  <p>IT represents the thing that want to do when I wake up in the morning.<p>
