    <p>This is my personal blog about Software Engineering, Computer Science, Technology, News, Ideas...<p>
    <p>I hate the word:"success", and am always looking for the "Aha moment"! Building stuff is one of the most excited things in the world. I am eager to learn more, explore more and do more! Keep calm & be cool!</p>
