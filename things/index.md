<p>I’m a voracious reader, reading the classic books is the one of the best things in the world.
I pick up reading seriously again from 2013, and have made it a daily habit. Here are some books I’ve finished recently.</p>
<p>This page will constantly update as I read more, so bookmark it if you want to check back in a few months. Fell free to give me any recommendations.<strong> Keep calm & be cool.</strong></p>
