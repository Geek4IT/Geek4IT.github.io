Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2nd Edition) Summary

Key Points
¡°Don¡¯t make me think¡± refers to the idea that when a web site makes you stop and think about what you¡¯re doing, it¡¯s making your life harder, and perhaps isn¡¯t designed as well as it could be.

Summary

Don¡¯t make me think.
Things that make you think add to your brain¡¯s workload. It might not be much, but these things add up, so every bit of clarity that can be added is welcome. Nobody likes feeling like they¡¯re not sure what to do.
Not everything can always be self-evident. If not, settle for self-explanatory.
How people use the web
Most people don¡¯t read an entire web page, but simply scan it for the first thing that looks good, which they then proceed to click. People don¡¯t attempt a thorough understanding of a web site, but prefer to satisfice - making do with what seems like pretty good choices.
Therefore:
Design pages for scanning, not reading
Create a clear visual hierarchy.
Nest text to show what belongs to what.
Conventions are useful. Stick to them unless you have a really good reason, because they help people to avoid thinking.
Clearly define portions of a page.
It should be very clear what is clickable.
Try and avoid ¡°noise¡±.
Mindless choices are good
In the sense that people don¡¯t mind clicking more, if they are confident that they¡¯re clicking on the right thing, and the choice was easy.
Writing for the web
Keep it brief.
Get rid of half the words, then get rid of half of what¡¯s left.
Instructions are often useless - it¡¯s far, far better to make things self-evident.
Navigation
Design for both browsers, who click around to find what they want, and searchers, who go immediately for the search box.
Some problems with browsing, as compared to the more ¡®human¡¯ experience of a store, are the lack of a sense of scale, no sense of direction from one place to the next, and no sense of where we are, exactly.
Navigation exists to guide us, to give us something to grasp, tell us where we are, tells us how to use the site, and if it works well, increases our confidence with the site.
¡°Persistant navigation¡± appears on every page, and usually refers to:
Site ID
Sections
Home link
Search link or box
Extra utilities
The home page, however, may be an exception to this rule, as well as pages that exist solely to provide a form to be filled out.
Sections can also be called the ¡°primary navigation¡± and are links to the main sections of the site.
Utilities are useful things that should be readily available, yet are not part of the hierarchy. They shouldn¡¯t be as prominent as the sections.
Page names
Every page should have a name, and it should be in the right place: framing the page¡¯s content.
The name should be prominent, as well as matching what you click to get there!
Breadcrumbs are a useful technique, but shouldn¡¯t be used in place of high quality navigation. The navigation should show at least the top two levels without having to resort to breadcrumbs.
Tabs are a great means of doing navigation because they¡¯re very obvious, impossible to miss, and look good, to boot.
¡°The trunk test¡±: if you¡¯ve been blindfolded and locked in a car trunk, you should be able to answer these questions about a site immediately when your blindfold is removed:
What site is it?
What page am I on?
What major sections does this site have?
Where can I go from here?
Where am I in relation to the rest of the site?
Where can I go to search?
Home page
The home page is tough, because everyone tries to pull it in a different direction. It must accomplish/contain the following:
Site identity and mission.
Hierarchy - give an idea of what the site contains.
Search box.
Teasers for content.
Current content.
Promotional offers.
Shortcuts for the most frequently viewed data.
Registration/login.
It should also show you how to get what you want from the site, tempt you with things you didn¡¯t know you were looking for, show you how to get started, and also give a good impression.
A home page is also the place where you need to spell out the big picture. Remember not to write too much, and include these elements:
tagline - next to the site id, sums up the whole site.
welcome blurb - a terse description of the site.
Be sure to test the home page with other people who are not ¡®blind¡¯ to the site because they¡¯ve been looking at it as much as you have.
A good tagline is clear and informative, normally between 5-10 words, and also convey what¡¯s different about your site, rather than vague, generic text.
